            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2008, Whitewater warriors Rafting began with a simple vision: to share the thrill of whitewater adventure with people of all ages and skill levels. What started as a small, family-owned operation on the scenic Clearwater River quickly gained a reputation for both exciting excursions and a commitment to safety. As word spread, the company expanded its reach to several rivers across the region, offering a variety of trips from adrenaline-packed rapids to serene, scenic floats. Over the years, Wild Waters Rafting has become a leader in eco-conscious rafting, ensuring that every trip respects the environment while giving adventurers the opportunity to experience nature's raw beauty up close. Today, we continue to grow, always staying true to our roots of fun, adventure, and safety.</p>
