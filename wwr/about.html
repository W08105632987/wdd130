            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="item"><p>Founded in 2008, Whitewater Warriors Rafting began with a simple vision: to share the thrill of whitewater adventure with people of all ages and skill levels. What started as a small, family-owned operation on the scenic Clearwater River quickly gained a reputation for both exciting excursions and a commitment to safety. In the early years, the company focused on creating memorable, adrenaline-filled experiences, emphasizing the importance of guiding adventurers through challenging rapids with care and expertise. As word spread about the incredible adventures offered, the company expanded its services to several other rivers in the region, each offering its own unique set of challenges and scenic beauty. The growth was organic, fueled by passionate guides and loyal customers who shared a love for the outdoors and a deep respect for the environment.</p></div>
